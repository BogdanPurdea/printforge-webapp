## Learning Strategy

1. **Start Small**: Pick 2-3 immediate improvements to build confidence
2. **Practice Daily**: Implement one small feature at a time
3. **Document Progress**: Keep notes on what you learn
4. **Seek Feedback**: Share code for review and improvement suggestions
5. **Build Portfolio**: Each feature adds to your development skills showcase
